# Transaction Processing Application

This code represents a simple transaction processing application. It simulates a basic transaction process involving card authentication, validation, and approval. The program interacts with user inputs through console I/O.

## Overview

The application follows a sequential process for handling a transaction:

1. **Setting Maximum Amount**: It prompts the user to set the maximum transaction amount, ensuring it's within the allowed limit.

2. **Collecting Card Data**: The program gathers cardholder information, including the cardholder's name, expiry date, and primary account number (PAN). It validates each input for accuracy and retries if incorrect.

3. **Card Validation**:
   - It validates the Primary Account Number (PAN) using the Luhn algorithm.
   - Checks if the card is expired by comparing the transaction date with the card's expiry date.

4. **Transaction Amount Validation**: Ensures the transaction amount doesn't exceed the set maximum amount.

5. **Database Validation**: Verifies the transaction data against a database for authorization.

6. **Transaction Approval/Decline**: Determines the transaction's approval or decline based on database validation results. If declined, it specifies reasons such as an invalid account, insufficient funds, or exceeding the maximum amount.

7. **Transaction Logging**: Saves the transaction details if approved.

## Main Function (`appStart()`)

The `appStart()` function serves as the main entry point for the transaction process. It handles user input, error checking, validation, and transaction approval or decline based on set criteria.

## Usage

The code snippet represents a simplified model of a transaction processing application. It's a conceptual example and does not interact with actual card data or databases. Ensure to integrate it with the necessary external libraries, database connections, and card reader systems for real-world application.

## Note

This description serves as an overview of the application's logical flow. It requires integration with appropriate hardware interfaces, database connections, and additional functionalities for real-world deployment.
